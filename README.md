# Group_Discussion_Portal
The main purpose of this project is to create an online portal for Group Discussion (GD) bookings, aiming to streamline the process of scheduling GD sessions and managing participant slots efficiently. 
This system will allow users to book slots for attending group discussions offered by an organization. 
Additionally, it keeps everyone's information safe and works well even as more people join in.
The Group Discussion Slot Booking System will provide the following key features:
- User registration and authentication
- Creating and managing slots(for admins)
- Booking discussion slots(for users)
- Notification system for slot booking confirmation and reminders
- Booked/Not booked details for admins
- Showing remarks for users
